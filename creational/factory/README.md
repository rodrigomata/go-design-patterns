# Factory Design Pattern

The Factory pattern is used when the creation of groups of families needs to be done by a family object creator, by delegating their creation.

## Characteristics

- Abstracts the user from knowing the struct needed
- Provides interface
- Allows with ease to downgrade/upgrade the implementation
- Provides extra layer of encapsulation
- Delegates the creation of families of objects to another package
